# Uno VS Computers

This is a program that resembles the UNO card game. You can play against 2 to 10 players.

How Uno works: https://www.unorules.com/

Note that the first player gets picked by random order when the 1st round and by winner on other rounds (Note: not true yet!)

This program is for me practicing how to code. ^^

## How to download
The only thing required to run this program is Python 3 (not 2). If you haven't done already, [download Python 3 here.](https://www.python.org/)

After you got Python 3 on your computer, you can get Git [here.](https://git-scm.com/) or by clicking `Clone or download` on green button and then click `Download ZIP`

## How to install

### Git
Type `git clone https://github.com/Archangel45/uno-vs-computer.git` on your terminal and then `cd uno-vs-computer`.

### ZIP
Extract the archive by using any extractor, including 7-Zip and the `zip` command.

## How to use this program

Run `python3 uno.py` on your terminal. For example:
```
$ python3 uno.py
```
and you're there. You go first and pick what card to drop by typing the numbers shown to the screen. Then, the computer does what it knows what to do and it's your turn again but this time, it has to be the right card to be dropped or otherwise use a wildcard.

If you don't have a wildcard, draw a card from the deck by typing `0`.

To check your cards in your hand, type `-1`.

To end your turn (if you don't want to do anything in your turn or nothing good happened after a draw), type `-2`.
